	SpaceShip			-	the main and super class for all the other SpaceShips, basically a template that
							houses every detail a standard ship should have.
	SpaceShipFactory	-	this class is used to create the different ships in the instance of the
							SpaceWars game, the created ships are based on the arguments to the program.
					('a' = aggressive, 'h' = human, 'r' = runner, 'd' = drunk, 's' = special, 'b' = basher)
	HumanSpaceShip		-	this class represents the human ship in the game SpaceWars, the player controls
							this ship, you can rotate it right or left, accelerate to a direction,
							shoot and teleport.
	AggressiveSpaceShip	-	this class represents the aggressive type of ship in the Spacewars game,
							it basically tries to run after the closest ship to it and fire when possible.
	BasherSpaceShip		-	this class represents the basher ship in the game Space Wars, it tries to *bash*
							enemies, which means run towards them and activate its shield before impact.
	DrunkardSpaceShip	-	this class represents the drunk space ship of the Space Wars game, he drank too
							much and it caused him to not exactly work the way you expect a qualified and
							dignified space ship pilot to work.
	RunnerSpaceShip		-	this class represents the runner type of ship in the Spacewars game, it tries to
							run away from the closest ship to it and teleport if it gets to close to it.
	SpecialSpaceShip	-	this space ship is a special ship with unique abilities, it behaves like any of
							the other ships at given times:
								when it has very low energy it runs like runner.
								when it has a good amount of energy it tries to bash but without shield
								(i will explain why in a second).
								when it has a lot of enery it tries to bash as before and shoot like basher.
							the reason it does not have a shield for bashing is because in addition to the
							way it acts depicted above it is also a vampire ship and so if it collides with
							another ship instead of losing health, regardless of if it had its shield on,
							this ship will get one Health Point up.
						
Design:
	i decided to design this ex by first making the template SpaceShip class and then extending it with
	every other ship class.
	after each ship i made sure to add it to the factory and test to see if it acts normaly
	(to what it was programed to be is normal).
	i added many constants to the original SpaceShip class because i thought it would make sense that each
	ship in this game would have attributes that are constant, such as how much energy they start with or
	how much shooting costs etc, i also made most of the members private and some that i needed for
	subclasses that i made protected.
	as to getters and setters, i only made the ones that i needed for the subclasses and made then protected
	as well because that made more sense to me in the mindset of minimal API.
	most of what i wrote seemed pretty staight forward to me in terms of comments so i figuerd it would be
	better to explain in general what each class is about instead of each function in each class
	(there aren't many either), with the obvious exception that is SpaceShip class itself.
	
Implementation issues:
	i'm not sure if this counts as an issue but the runner ship, aggresive ship and basher ship have very
	similar chunks of code that i couldn't really figure out what to do with, i thought of making a seperate
	class for themselves but it would only shorten my code by a third (3 methods become 2).
	regardless of that choosing what and how the drunk and special ships were going to be was difficult
	because i didn't really have control over many of the things that the ships could do, meaning the
	torpedoes or acceleration or shield size and all those were in the classes the university has and we
	were not given access to.
	
Answers to questions:
	there were none.
